            <h3>Understanding Emotional Availability</h3>
            <p>Emotional availability entails being there for your child both physically and emotionally. It's about actively 
                listening to their feelings, acknowledging their emotions, and providing support when needed. Additionally, it
                involves being able to express your own feelings in an appropriate manner. Being emotionally available isn't about 
                perfection; it's about creating a nurturing environment where your child feels heard and understood.</p>

            <h3>Importance of Emotional Availability</h3>
            <p>Research indicates that children with emotionally available parents tend to have better mental health outcomes, higher
                self-esteem, and stronger relationships later in life. When children feel emotionally supported, they are more likely
                to develop effective coping mechanisms and a positive sense of self-worth. Moreover, emotional availability fosters 
                trust and strengthens the bond between parent and child.</p>
