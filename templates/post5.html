        <h3>Here are some strategies to determine a healthy and reasonable limit on screen time:</h3>
        
        <section>
            <h4>Stay Informed About Technology</h4>
            <p>Kids today are highly knowledgeable about technology, often more so than adults. It's 
                crucial for parents to stay informed about the latest apps, games, and social media trends. 
                This knowledge enables you to guide your child effectively and discuss the potential risks 
                associated with certain digital activities.</p>

        <section>
            <h4>Establish “No-Tech” Zones</h4>
            <p>Create specific areas in your home where electronic devices are not allowed, such as the 
                dining room or kitchen. This encourages family interactions and meals without the 
                distractions of screens.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h4>Designate Times to Disconnect</h4>
            <p>Set specific times for the whole family to unplug from screens, like during dinner or an 
                hour before bed. These moments provide opportunities for meaningful family interactions and 
                help build stronger bonds.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h4>Implement Parental Controls</h4>
            <p>Utilize parental control features on routers, web browsers, TVs, and smartphones to protect 
                your child from inappropriate content. These tools allow you to filter and block unwanted 
                material, ensuring a safer online experience.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h4>Communicate the Importance of Screen Time Limits</h4>
            <p>Explain to your child why it's important to limit screen time, emphasizing the potential 
                downsides of excessive screen use. Engage the whole family in discussions about these 
                boundaries, helping everyone understand and agree on the rules.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h4>Request Your Child’s Account Passwords</h4>
            <p>Consider asking for access to your child's online and social media accounts to monitor their 
                interactions and protect them from cyberbullying. Discuss privacy and safety together to 
                find a balance between oversight and independence.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h4>Promote Alternative Activities</h4>
            <p>Encourage your child to engage in activities that don't involve screens, such as outdoor 
                play, reading, or board games. Establish a consistent schedule for screen time to set clear 
                expectations and reduce conflicts.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h4>Treat Screen Time as a Privilege</h4>
            <p>Make screen time a reward rather than a right. Use it as an incentive for good behavior 
                while enforcing daily limits. This approach helps children understand the value of 
                moderation and encourages positive behavior.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h4>Maintain Screen-Free Bedrooms</h4>
            <p>Keep electronic devices out of your child's bedroom to better monitor their screen usage and 
                promote healthier sleep habits. This includes TVs, computers, and handheld devices that can 
                be tempting to use late at night.</p>
