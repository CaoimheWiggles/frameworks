            <p>As adolescents transition into their teenage years, both they and their parents must 
                adapt to new dynamics. Teenagers begin asserting their independence, a crucial step 
                towards adulthood, while still relying on their parents for support.</p>
            <p>A significant shift occurs in the parent-child relationship, particularly in the 
                time spent together. While teens may have been closely attached in earlier years, 
                they increasingly seek companionship among peers. Even when at home, they may prefer 
                solitude, engaging in activities like listening to music or retreating to their rooms.</p>
            <p>This change isn't a reflection of diminished love but rather a natural inclination towards 
                autonomy and exploration. Teens start forming their own beliefs, making decisions, and 
                assuming more responsibilities. Although the quantity of time spent with them may diminish, 
                opportunities arise to make the remaining moments enriching and significant. Approaching 
                parenting with positivity fosters trust and strengthens the bond during this transformative 
                period.</p>
